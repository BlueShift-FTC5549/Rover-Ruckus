This repository is the version control hub of Team Blue Shift [FTC5549] for the FIRST Tech Challenge 2018-2019 event "Rover Ruckus". Updating nearly daily, the repository will include a collection of Autonomous and TeleOP programs as well as custom libraries and objects used during our team's competition matches.

Blue Shift shares all of our code so that other teams may learn from our programming and so that we may also learn from others. We are completely transparent with our progress.
